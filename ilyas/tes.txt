1-/*
 * Removes a specific node from the environment variables linked list.
 * Handles proper unlinking of doubly-linked list node by updating
 * previous and next node pointers. Frees all allocated memory including
 * key, value strings and the node structure itself.
 *
 * @param env_list: Pointer to the head of environment list
 * @param node: List node to remove and free
 * @return: Always returns 1 (success indicator)
 * Side effects: Modifies linked list structure, frees memory
 */
 2-/*
 * Initializes a minimal environment when none exists.
 * Creates essential shell environment variables including PWD (current working
 * directory), OLDPWD, SHLVL (shell level), and _ (last command). Used when
 * shell starts with empty environment or as fallback initialization.
 *
 * @param env: Pointer to environment variables linked list (should be empty)
 * @return: 1 if environment was initialized, 0 if environment already exists
 * Side effects: Allocates memory for environment nodes, calls getcwd()
 */
 3-/*
 * Implements the unset builtin command functionality.
 * Removes specified environment variables from the shell's environment.
 * Iterates through all provided variable names and removes matching entries
 * from the environment list. Protects special variables like '_' from removal.
 *
 * @param cmd: Array of variable names to unset (cmd[0] is "unset")
 * @param env: Pointer to environment variables linked list
 * @return: Always returns 1 (success indicator)
 * Side effects: Modifies environment list by removing specified variables
