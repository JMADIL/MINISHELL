lets firt made an ft_error.c file that will contain sume functions that gona help us and 
we will uset in auther files
-this is a descreptions of the functions that i want
1-/*
 * Safely frees a character pointer and sets it to NULL.
 * Provides null-safe string deallocation by checking for null pointer
 * before freeing. Sets pointer to NULL after freeing to prevent
 * double-free errors and dangling pointer issues.
 *
 * @param s: Character pointer to free
 * Side effects: Frees memory if pointer is not NULL, sets pointer to NULL
 */
 2-/*
 * Prints error message and exits with specified status code.
 * Formats and displays shell error messages with consistent format:
 * "minishell : [command]: [error]". Terminates the current process
 * with the provided exit status after printing the error.
 *
 * @param cmd_name: Command name to include in error message (can be NULL)
 * @param error: Error message string to display
 * @param status: Exit status code for process termination
 * Side effects: Writes error to stderr, terminates process
 */
 3-/*
 * Opens files with specified flags for redirection operations.
 * Handles different file opening modes: truncate (flag 0), read-only (flag 1),
 * and append (flag 2). Reports appropriate error messages for common
 * failure cases like file not found, directory access, and permission issues.
 *
 * @param file: Filename to open
 * @param flag: Opening mode (0=truncate, 1=read, 2=append)
 * @return: File descriptor on success, -1 on failure (with error reported)
 * Side effects: Opens file, may write error messages, sets g_exit_status
 * on error
 */
 4-/*
 * Handles cleanup and error reporting for execve failures.
 * Frees allocated memory for command path, name, and environment array
 * before reporting execution errors. Determines appropriate error message
 * and exit code based on errno (permission denied vs general failure).
 *
 * @param cmd_path: Pointer to command path string to free
 * @param cmd_name: Pointer to command name string to free
 * @param envp: Pointer to environment array to free
 * Side effects: Frees memory, reports error, terminates process
 */
 now i wanna made the ambiguous functions as errors2.c file this is a descreption of he functions 
 that i will use
 1-/*
 * Checks if a filename contains spaces that would make redirection ambiguous.
 * Detects cases where variable expansion or other operations result in
 * filenames containing spaces, which creates ambiguous redirection in shell.
 * Returns true for empty/null strings and strings containing spaces.
 *
 * @param file: Filename string to check for ambiguity
 * @return: true if filename is ambiguous (empty or contains spaces), false
 * otherwise
 */
 2-/*
 * Completes execution process with proper signal handling and child waiting.
 * Sets up parent process signal handling for waiting state, waits for all
 * child processes to complete, then restores original signal handlers.
 * Used to properly finish command execution in pipeline.
 *
 * Side effects: Modifies signal handlers, waits for child processes
